# Contributing to RI Reiki Resources

Thank you for contributing! This guide makes it simple.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find Free Resources

Look for resources that are:
- ✅ **Public domain** (no copyright)
- ✅ **Creative Commons** (CC BY, CC BY-SA, CC0)
- ✅ **Free to use** for educational purposes

**Always check the license before adding resources.**

### 2. Organize by Category

Place resources in the right folder:
- **Images** → `01_Images/[category]/`
- **Teaching materials** → `02_Teaching_Materials/[category]/`
- **Media** → `03_Media/[category]/`
- **Links** → `04_Resources_Links/`
- **RI-specific** → `05_RI_Guided/[category]/`

### 3. Add Attribution

Every resource needs:
- **Source** (where it came from)
- **License** (what license it uses)
- **Attribution** (who created it)

Create a README.md in the folder with this information.

### 4. Submit

**Option A: GitHub Pull Request**
1. Fork the repository
2. Add your resources
3. Create a pull request
4. We'll review and merge

**Option B: Issue**
1. Open an issue describing the resource
2. Include link and license information
3. We'll add it

## What We're Looking For

### High Priority

- Free educational guides
- CC-licensed teaching materials
- Links to free courses/resources

### Quality Standards
- Clear, useful resources

- Correct license information
- Organized properly

## What NOT to Include

- ❌ Copyrighted material (unless you have permission)
- ❌ Resources that require payment
- ❌ Low-quality or unclear resources
- ❌ Resources without clear licensing

## Contribution Process

1. **Check** - Does this resource fit? Is it free?
2. **Verify** - What's the license? Can we use it?
3. **Organize** - Put it in the right folder
4. **Document** - Add attribution and license info
5. **Submit** - Create PR or issue

## Questions?

- **License questions?** Open an issue
